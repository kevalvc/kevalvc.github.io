          <h2>The Journey</h2>
          <p> I am a tech savvy guy with a nod of experimenting and trying out new technology and learning new information. This bought me to San Diego State University to pursue my Masters in Computer Science. I am currently an Experienced Graduate Student with a demonstrated history of working with several languages such as Python, Scala, C, C++ and Java.
              <br>
              <br>
              I have honed my Software Development skills through developing several projects and have build several projects on multiple platforms using Django, JavaScript, Java, etc.
              <br>
              My most notable work until now has been my Internship with Endera and PayPal where I got to work and build my skills with an entirely new Tech Stack and successfully built 3 different projects within the span of 12 weeks. During this time, I mainly focused working with Scala, Python, Spark, Kafka, JavaScript and many other tools.
              <br>
              <br>
              Having studied several courses like Machine Learning, Applied Computer Vision, Advanced Object Oriented Programming and Combinatorial Algorithms, I have developed a fascination towards the field of Data Analysis, Neural Models and Computational Programming. This led me to work on several projects using various Python and Scala based libraries including Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch. This even helped me complete my Research Assistance with my professor where I got to focus on those tools.
